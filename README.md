## Why This Exists

As a web developer, improving my typing skills is basically sharpening my proverbial axe. I wanted a simple way to warm up my fingers for the day and get more efficient at typing; the stats create a little competition with myself to get better over time. Now there are plenty of great typing practice sites out there but that gets me to my second motivation.

As a Christian, any time spent with scripture is time well spent. It can be challenging to get in front of the Word as often as I should, so this app provides a fun and interactive way to engage with scripture daily. It's a little more than just reading, it's just one way of interacting with the Word through typing and memorization.

I hope this project serves you well and brings you closer to the Word.

## Words Per Minute (WPM) Formula

Accuracy = Correct Characters on First Attempt<sup>1</sup> / Total Characters

WPM = (Number of Characters / 5) \* Accuracy / (Time in Minutes)

<sup>1</sup>Accuracy is calculated based on whether each character is typed correctly on the first attempt; corrected mistakes still count as incorrect for accuracy purposes.

## Attribution

Scripture passages are fetched from the [Free Use Bible API](https://bible.helloao.org/). Text is used for educational and personal practice purposes.
